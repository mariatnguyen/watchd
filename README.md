# Watchd

Watchd is an application built on [React](http://reactjs.org/) that uses the [The Movie Database API](https://api.themoviedb.org/).

Work in progress...


## V1

* Add search functionality
* Create watched list and functionality
* Include add and remove options

### Need to do

* Add caching
* Create a friendly look for the introduction of the app instead of just a blank screen with a search bar
* Sometimes there are blank pages in search pages if the specific object (movie) isn't fully there: image missing, overview missing. Find a way to skip these pages... 

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```
